# Setup

> Using TailwindCSS in your Nuxt project is only one command away ✨

## Prerequisites

Tailwind 2 needs PostCSS 8, to work with Nuxt 2, this module uses [@nuxt/postcss8](https://github.com/nuxt/postcss8) that requires Nuxt `>= 2.15.3`.

:::alert
Please make sure to update your Nuxt version to be minimum [v2.15.3](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.15.3).
:::

:::::code-group
::::code-block{label="Yarn" active}

```bash
yarn upgrade nuxt
```

::::
::::code-block{label="NPM"}

```bash
npm update nuxt
```

::::
:::::

## Installation

1. Add `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` and `postcss` dependencies to your project:

   :::::code-group
   ::::code-block{label="Yarn" active}

   ```bash
   yarn add --dev @nuxtjs/tailwindcss postcss@latest
   ```

   ::::code-block
   ::::code-block{label="NPM"}

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @nuxtjs/tailwindcss postcss@latest
   ```

   ::::
   :::::

2. Add it to your `buildModules` section in your `nuxt.config.js`:

   ```ts [nuxt.config.js]
   export default {
     buildModules: ["@nuxtjs/tailwindcss"],
   };
   ```

3. Create your `tailwind.config.js` running:

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

:::alert{type="success"}
That's it! You can now use Tailwind classes in your Nuxt app ✨
:::

:::alert{type="info"}
Discover your color palette based on your Tailwind config with the [Tailwind viewer](/tailwind/viewer).

## Tailwind Just-In-Time

Tailwind recently released [@tailwindcss/jit](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/just-in-time-the-next-generation-of-tailwind-css) to make the web development much faster.

To activate the option:

- create and modify your custom `tailwind.config.js` as mentioned in [the tailwind's documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode#enabling-jit-mode)
- then override the purge config directly into the `tailwind.config.js` file to select the file to want to watch

```ts [tailwind.config.js]
module.exports = {
  mode: "jit",
};
```

_The double tilde to mention the Nuxt config file is an alias to the root directory which could be different from the sources directory._

Restart your Nuxt server and see how fast it is now ⚡️

## Tailwind Files

When running `nuxt dev`, this module will look for these two files:

- `./assets/css/tailwind.css`
- `./tailwind.config.js`

If they don't exist, the module will inject a basic configuration for each one so you don't have to create these files.

:::alert{type="info"}
You can configure the paths in the [module options](/options).
:::

Learn more about overwriting the Tailwind configuration in the [Tailwind Config](/tailwind/config) section.

## Options

You can customize the module behaviour by using the `tailwindcss` property in `nuxt.config.js`:

```ts [nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  tailwindcss: {
    // Options
  },
};
```

See the [module options](/options).
