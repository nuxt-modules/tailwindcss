## Installation

1. Install `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` dependency to your project:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn add -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
```

```bash [npm]
npm install -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm i -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
```

::

2. Add it to your `modules` section in your `nuxt.config`:

::code-group
```ts [Nuxt 3]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxtjs/tailwindcss']
})
```

```ts [Nuxt 2]
export default {
  buildModules: ['@nuxtjs/tailwindcss']
}
```
::

::callout{color="green" icon="i-ph-check-circle-duotone"}
That's it! You can now use Tailwind classes in your Nuxt app ✨
::

::callout{color="amber" icon="i-ph-warning-duotone"}
For Nuxt 2.15 and lower, also add [`@nuxt/postcss8`](https://github.com/nuxt/postcss8) to your dependencies.
::


::callout{color="blue" icon="i-ph-info-duotone"}
Discover your color palette based on your Tailwind config with the [Tailwind viewer](/tailwind/viewer).

### Nightly Releases

After each commit is merged into the `main` branch of `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` and **passing all tests**, we trigger an automated npm release using GitHub Actions and [changelogen](https://github.com/unjs/changelogen).

You can opt in to use this release channel and avoid waiting for the next release and helping the module by beta testing changes.

The build and publishing method and quality of nightly releases are the same as stable ones. The only difference is that you should often check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/tailwindcss) for updates. There is a slight chance of regressions not being caught during the review process and by the automated tests. Therefore, we internally use this channel to double-check everything before each release.

### Opting into the nightly channel

Update `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` dependency inside `package.json`:

```diff [package.json]
{
  "devDependencies": {
-   "@nuxtjs/tailwindcss": "^6.10.0"
+   "@nuxtjs/tailwindcss": "npm:@nuxtjs/tailwindcss@nightly"
  }
}
```

Remove lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`) and reinstall dependencies.

#### Opting out from the edge channel

Update `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` dependency inside `package.json`:

```diff [package.json]
{
  "devDependencies": {
-   "@nuxtjs/tailwindcss": "npm:@nuxtjs/tailwindcss@nightly"
+   "@nuxtjs/tailwindcss": "^6.10.0"
  }
}
```

Remove lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`) and reinstall dependencies.

## Tailwind Files

When running `npm run dev`, this module will look for these files:

- `./assets/css/tailwind.css`
- `./tailwind.config.{js,cjs,mjs,ts}`

If these files don't exist, the module will automatically generate a basic configuration for them, so you don't have to create these files manually.

You can create the `tailwind.config.js` file by running the following command:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

::callout{color="blue" icon="i-ph-info-duotone"}
You can configure the paths in the [module options](/getting-started/configuration).
::

If you're going to create your own Tailwind CSS file, make sure to add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwind’s layer types (base, components, and utilities).

```css [~/assets/css/tailwind.css]
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Learn more about overwriting the Tailwind configuration in the [Tailwind Config](/tailwind/config) section.

## Options

You can customize the module's behavior by using the `tailwindcss` property in `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  tailwindcss: {
    // Options
  }
})
```

See the [module options](/getting-started/configuration).
