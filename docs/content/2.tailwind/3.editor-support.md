Tailwind provides an [extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense), which enables advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

There are a few things you need to keep in mind so that the extension works correctly:

1. You need to have a `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of your project, so that the extension gets enabled. You can create the file using `npx tailwindcss init`. The file can have another name, such as `tailwind.config.cjs` in which case you have to configure the extension so that it picks up the new name:

```json [.vscode/settings.json]
"tailwindCSS.experimental.configFile": "tailwind.config.cjs"
```

If you have multiple Tailwind config files, you can use the array syntax:

```json [.vscode/settings.json]
"tailwindCSS.experimental.configFile": {
  "themes/simple/tailwind.config.js": "themes/simple/**",
  "themes/neon/tailwind.config.js": "themes/neon/**"
}
```

2. The tailwind configuration file must not have any TypeScript or ESM syntax in the file. That means that you have to use CommonJS exports and can't use a `tailwind.config.ts` file with TypeScript syntax. See https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense/issues/348#issuecomment-1111313685.

3. Add the following configuration to your `.vscode/settings.json` file, so that Tailwind directives have proper autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting:

```json [.vscode/settings.json]
"files.associations": {
	"*.css": "tailwindcss"
}
```
