Tailwind provides an [extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense), which enables advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

There are a few things you need to keep in mind so that the extension works correctly:

1. Currently, [Tailwind does not support a configuration file in TypeScript or ESM syntax format]( https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense/issues/348#issuecomment-1111313685). To workaround this limitation, and also include configuration from other places, the module automatically generates a configuration file in CommonJS format in the `.nuxt` folder. You need to change your VSCode settings to point to the generated config file.

    ```json [.vscode/settings.json]
    "tailwindCSS.experimental.configFile": ".nuxt/tailwind.config.cjs"
    ```

2. Add the following configuration to your `.vscode/settings.json` file, so that Tailwind directives have proper autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting:

    ```json [.vscode/settings.json]
    "files.associations": {
	    "*.css": "tailwindcss"
    }
    ```
