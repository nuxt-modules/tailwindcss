Tailwind provides an [extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense), which enables advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

There are a few things you need to keep in mind so that the extension works correctly:

1. In case you specify your Tailwind configuration in a `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of your project, the extension gets enabled and should pick up this configuration automatically. You can create the file using `npx tailwindcss init`. The file can have another name, such as `tailwind.config.cjs` in which case you have to configure the extension so that it picks up the new name:

    ```json [.vscode/settings.json]
    "tailwindCSS.experimental.configFile": "tailwind.config.cjs"
    ```

    If you have multiple Tailwind config files, you can use the array syntax:

    ```json [.vscode/settings.json]
    "tailwindCSS.experimental.configFile": {
      "themes/simple/tailwind.config.js": "themes/simple/**",
      "themes/neon/tailwind.config.js": "themes/neon/**"
    }
    ```

2. Currently, [Tailwind does not support a configuration file in TypeScript or ESM syntax format]( https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense/issues/348#issuecomment-1111313685), nor does it pick up the Tailwind configuration in `nuxt.config.ts`. If you prefer one of these options to specify the configuration, you have to point the extension to the configuration file in CommonJS format that the module automatically generates in the `.nuxt` folder: 

    ```json [.vscode/settings.json]
    "tailwindCSS.experimental.configFile": ".nuxt/tailwind.config.cjs"
    ```

3. Add the following configuration to your `.vscode/settings.json` file, so that Tailwind directives have proper autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting:

    ```json [.vscode/settings.json]
    "files.associations": {
	    "*.css": "tailwindcss"
    }
    ```
