Tailwind provides an [extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense), that provides advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

You can [install it via the Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).

Add the following configuration to your `.vscode/settings.json` file, so that Tailwind directives have proper autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting:

```json [.vscode/settings.json]
"files.associations": {
    "*.css": "tailwindcss"
},
"editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "strings": true
}
```

If you use pnpm, ensure that tailwindcss is installed in your top-level node_modules folder.

## String Classes Autocomplete

When using strings of Tailwind classes, you can enable IntelliSense suggestions using the [`editorSupport.autocompleteUtil`](/getting-started/configuration#editorsupport) option. You will have to add the following VSCode setting:

```diff [.vscode/settings.json]
// ...
+ "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": ["tw`(.*?)`", "tw\\('(.*?)'\\)"],
"files.associations": {
    "*.css": "tailwindcss"
},
// ...
```

Once added, the new utility function can be used as follows, providing IntelliSense suggestions when writing Tailwind classes:

```vue [index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const variantClasses = {
  primary: tw`bg-red-400`,
  secondary: tw('bg-green-400')
}
</script>
```

## Configuration IntelliSense

Since Tailwind CSS v3.3, [ESM/TS configuration has been supported](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3-3#esm-and-type-script-support) so your editor should automatically configure autocomplete based on your `tailwind.config`. If you have a complex Nuxt project with multiple Tailwind configurations that are within layers, passed from hooks or inline `nuxt.config` and want to use a merged configuration, the module generates it in `.nuxt/tailwind.config.cjs` that you can use by adding the following VSCode setting:

```diff [.vscode/settings.json]
// ...
+ "tailwindCSS.experimental.configFile": ".nuxt/tailwind.config.cjs",
"files.associations": {
    "*.css": "tailwindcss"
},
// ...
```

If you require more customisation to what configuration the IntelliSense extension reads, you can take advantage of hooks, especially the `tailwindcss:resolvedConfig` hook that runs the configuration through [`tailwindcss/resolveConfig`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/master/resolveConfig.js) to provide the complete config object.

```ts [modules/tw-cjs-config.ts]
import { defineNuxtModule, addTemplate } from '@nuxt/kit'

export default defineNuxtModule({
  setup (options, nuxt) {
    nuxt.hook('tailwindcss:resolvedConfig', (config) => {
      addTemplate({
        filename: 'intellisense-tw.cjs', // gets prepended by .nuxt/
        getContents: () => `
          /* my-comment */
          module.exports = ${JSON.stringify(config)}
        `,
        write: true
      })
    })
  }
})
```

This hook allows you to customize your generated template in different ways (e.g., different filename, contents, etc.) through a module. Please be aware that using `JSON.stringify` will remove plugins from your configuration.
